## Notification Priority Logic

Notifications are sorted based on:

| Notification Type | Priority |
|-------------------|----------|
| Placement         | Highest  |
| Result            | Medium   |
| Event             | Lowest   |

If two notifications have the same priority, the newest notification is displayed first based on timestamp.
