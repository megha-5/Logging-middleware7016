Campus Priority Inbox is a responsive dashboard application that fetches notifications from an API and intelligently sorts them using a priority-based algorithm.

The application ensures that students see the most important notifications first, such as placement updates, exam results, and campus events.

## Notification Priority Logic

Notifications are sorted based on:

| Notification Type | Priority |
|-------------------|----------|
| Placement         | Highest  |
| Result            | Medium   |
| Event             | Lowest   |



If two notifications have the same priority, the newest notification is displayed first based on timestamp.
